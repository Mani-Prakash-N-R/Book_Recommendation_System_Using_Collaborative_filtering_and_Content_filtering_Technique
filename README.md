# Book_Recommendation_System_Using_Collaborative_filtering_and_Content_filtering_Technique

# Overview
This project implements a book recommendation system that uses two popular techniques: Content-based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering. The system suggests books to users based on their preferences and the collective behavior of other users.

# Features
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends books based on the similarity of book features (e.g., genre, author, description).
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends books based on user behavior (e.g., ratings, reviews, purchase history) and similarity to other users.
Hybrid Recommendation: Combines both content-based and collaborative methods for enhanced accuracy.

# Technologies Used
Backend: Python
Libraries/Frameworks:
pandas, numpy for data processing
scikit-learn for machine learning (similarity calculations)
surprise for collaborative filtering
flask for API and web integration (if applicable)
Data: User ratings, book details (title, genre, author, etc.)

Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.x
pip (Python package manager)
Setup
Clone the repository:
cd book-recommendation-system

Install required dependencies:
# code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare your dataset:

You will need a dataset containing book information (title, author, genre, etc.) and user interaction data (ratings, reviews, etc.).
Ensure your dataset is in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, JSON) for the system to process.
Run the recommendation engine:

# code
python recommendation_system.py
The script will load the dataset, apply content-based filtering and collaborative filtering, and output book recommendations.

API Integration (Optional)
If you want to integrate the recommendation system with a web application, you can run a Flask API:

# code
python app.py
The API will expose endpoints to get recommendations, e.g., GET /recommendations?user_id=123.

Usage
Content-Based Recommendations: The system recommends books similar to a given book based on attributes like genre, author, and description.
Collaborative Filtering Recommendations: The system recommends books based on the behavior of similar users (e.g., users who rated similar books highly).
Hybrid Model: Combines both techniques to provide the best of both worlds.

Example usage:
# python code
# Content-based recommendation for a book
book_recommendations = get_content_based_recommendations(book_id)

# Collaborative filtering recommendation for a user
user_recommendations = get_collaborative_filtering_recommendations(user_id)
Evaluation
The performance of the recommendation system can be evaluated using metrics like:

Precision: How many of the recommended books were liked by the user.
Recall: How many of the liked books were recommended.
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): For measuring prediction accuracy in collaborative filtering.
